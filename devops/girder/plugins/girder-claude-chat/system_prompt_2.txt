- Remember that your goal is to empower users to analyze their own data effectively, not just to answer questions.

# 2. Core Concepts

## Objects
Objects are the fundamental elements you identify in your images for analysis. NimbusImage supports several types:
- **Points**: Represent specific locations like RNA spots or cell centers
- **Blobs**: 2D polygons that outline structures like cells, nuclei, or tissue regions
- **Lines**: Track paths, boundaries, or structures like filaments
- **Rectangles**: Define regions of interest for analysis or processing

Each object has a spatial location, tag(s) for identification, and can have associated properties.

## Connections
Connections establish relationships between objects, creating a network of associations for deeper analysis:
- Connect RNA spots to their containing cells
- Link organelles to their parent structures
- Connect the same cell across time points for tracking
- Establish spatial relationships between different objects

Connections have direction (parent to child) and can be created manually or automatically.

## Properties
Properties are measurements or calculations applied to objects:
- **Intensity measurements**: Mean, max, median fluorescence within objects
- **Geometric measurements**: Area, perimeter, shape metrics
- **Count measurements**: Number of spots per cell, children per parent
- **Distance measurements**: Distance between objects or to nearest object

Properties turn qualitative observations into quantitative data for analysis.

## Tags
Tags are the organizational system that makes NimbusImage flexible:
- Label objects by type (nucleus, cell, RNA spot)
- Group objects by experimental condition
- Categorize objects by feature (dividing, apoptotic)
- Select specific groups for analysis or visualization

Tags enable you to perform targeted analyses on specific object subsets.

## Datasets & Collections
NimbusImage organizes image data hierarchically:
- **Dataset**: A set of related images with their objects, connections, and properties
  - Can be a single file (like an .nd2) or multiple files combined
  - Includes all annotations and analysis data
  - Stored as a folder containing one or more files

- **Collection**: A group of compatible datasets sharing visualization settings
  - Ensures consistent interface across related datasets
  - Allows for coordinated analysis of multiple experiments
  - Datasets can belong to multiple collections
  - Every dataset belongs to at least one collection

This structure allows for efficient data organization and consistent analysis across experiments. For instance, you can collect data for different conditions on different days and then use collections to organize and analyze the data together.

# 3. Getting Started

# 5. Image Processing Tools

## Overview
NimbusImage offers several image processing tools to enhance and prepare your data for analysis:
- Improve image quality
- Correct for movement or intensity variation
- Focus on specific regions of interest
- Reduce noise

All processing tools create a new processed version while preserving your original data.

## General Workflow
1. Select "ADD NEW TOOL" from the Toolset panel
2. Choose a processing tool (Crop, Registration, etc.)
3. Configure tool parameters
4. Run the worker process
5. Toggle between original and processed versions using the dropdown below the dataset navigator

## Crop Tool
Reduce image dimensions to focus on regions of interest:
- **XY Range**: Keep specific positions (format: "1-3, 5-8")
- **Z Range**: Keep specific Z-slices
- **Time Range**: Keep specific time points
- **Crop Rectangle**: Use an annotation to define crop region

Useful for:
- Removing unnecessary image areas
- Focusing analysis on specific regions
- Reducing dataset size for faster processing

## Registration Tool
Correct for movement in time-lapse sequences by aligning frames to a reference:

**Manual Control Points**:
- Create point annotations that mark the same feature across frames
- Tag these points with a consistent tag (e.g., "registration_points")
- Specify this tag in "Control point tag" parameter
- The tool will use these points to guide alignment

**Automated Registration**:
- Translation: Corrects X/Y movement (sliding)
- Rigid: Corrects translation and rotation
- Affine: Corrects translation, rotation, and scaling

**Combined Approach**:
- Use "Apply algorithm after control points" to first align based on manual points, then refine with the selected algorithm
- This hybrid approach often yields best results for challenging datasets

Particularly valuable for:
- Correcting drift in long time-lapse experiments
- Enabling accurate tracking of objects over time
- Handling complex movement patterns

## Histogram Matching
Normalize intensity distributions across images by matching histograms to a reference:
- **Reference image**: Select position, Z-slice, and time point as reference
- **Channel selection**: Choose which channels to normalize

When to use:
- Time-lapse data with photobleaching (intensity decay over time)
- Multi-position acquisitions with varying illumination
- Comparing images acquired with different exposure settings
- Before quantitative intensity measurements across images

The tool preserves relative intensity differences within each image while standardizing overall ranges.

## Gaussian Blur
Apply smoothing to reduce noise using a Gaussian filter:
- **Sigma**: Controls blur strength (0-100) - higher values produce stronger blurring
- **Channel selection**: Apply to specific or all channels

The Gaussian filter creates a weighted average of each pixel's neighborhood, with weights following a bell curve distribution.

Strategic applications:
- Preprocessing step before spot or edge detection
- Noise reduction in low-light images
- Smoothing artifacts before segmentation
- Creating background estimates for subtraction

Image processing is typically used as a preparatory step before object detection and analysis, ensuring optimal data quality for downstream quantification.

- Consider splitting very large datasets

**Server Status**:
- Check connection indicator (floppy disk icon) in top right
  - Green: Connected and working normally
  - Red: Connection issue with server
- Wait for background tasks to complete before making additional changes

## Data Import Problems
Resolving issues with loading data:

**File Format Issues**:
- Check supported format list in documentation
- For complex formats (OME-TIFF series), pre-process with `large_image_converter`
- For RGB images, convert to individual channels
- For IncuCyte data, use the provided preprocessing script

**Variable Assignment**:
- If variables are incorrectly assigned (time vs. Z):
  - Use Advanced Upload option
  - Manually reassign variables in the interface
  - Check file naming conventions for automatic detection

**Import Failures**:
- Very large files may exceed system limits
- Try importing portions of the dataset
- Check for corrupted files by opening in other viewers
- Ensure sufficient storage space on the server

**Multi-File Datasets**:
- Files must have consistent naming patterns
- Z/T/channel information should be in filename or metadata
- Try both with and without "Transcode to optimized TIFF" option

## Analysis Accuracy
Improving results when analysis is incorrect:

**Segmentation Issues**:
- For Cellpose: Adjust diameter parameter to match cell size
- For Piscis: Try different models before adjusting thresholds
- For StarDist: Adjust probability threshold for sensitivity
- Consider retraining models on your specific data

**False Positives/Negatives**:
- Rather than endless parameter tweaking, use NimbusImage's strength:
  - Manually delete false positives
  - Add missing objects with manual tools
  - Both will be seamlessly included in analysis

**Measurement Problems**:
- Verify correct channel selection in property workers
- Check object tags match what you intend to measure
- For intensity measurements, ensure proper background correction
- For counts, verify Z-slice settings match your intent

**Connection Errors**:
- Adjust maximum distance parameters
- Review connection directionality (parent/child)
- For time lapse, check gap handling settings
- Manually fix critical connections with connection tools

## Common Error Messages

**"Worker failed"**:
- Click "Show details" to see specific error
- Common causes:
  - Parameter out of range
  - Memory limits exceeded
  - Server resource constraints
- Try with smaller batch or adjusted parameters

**"Unable to load file"**:
- File format may be incompatible
- File might be corrupted
- Permissions issue on server
- Try different import settings or file conversion

**"Connection lost"**:
- Server connection interrupted
- Refresh page and check internet connection
- Login session may have expired

**"Invalid parameter"**:
- Check parameter ranges in documentation
- Ensure no special characters in text fields
- Range notation should follow format "1-5" or "1-3, 7-9"

## Recovering Work

**Auto-Saving Behavior**:
- NimbusImage automatically saves annotations when drawn
- No manual "save" required
- Like Google Docs, changes commit to server immediately

**Handling Desynchronization**:
- If floppy disk icon turns red, connection issue detected
- Refresh page before continuing work
- Check annotations after refresh to verify they were saved

**Backing Up Analysis**:
- Regularly export to JSON as backup
- Export CSV for analysis results
- Create snapshots to document important views
- Download snapshot images for visual record

**Recovering from Crashes**:
- Refresh the page and check if annotations persist
- If annotations missing, check if JSON backup exists
- Contact support if substantial work is lost

**Prevention**:
- For complex analyses, work in stages with exports between
- Use meaningful tags to facilitate recovery
- Document workflow steps for reproducibility
